/**
 * The range of valid values for a date-time field.
 * <p>
 * All {@link TemporalField} instances have a valid range of values.
 * For example, the ISO day-of-month runs from 1 to somewhere between 28 and 31.
 * This class captures that valid range.
 * <p>
 * It is important to be aware of the limitations of this class.
 * Only the minimum and maximum values are provided.
 * It is possible for there to be invalid values within the outer range.
 * For example, a weird field may have valid values of 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, thus
 * have a range of '1 - 7', despite that fact that values 3 and 5 are invalid.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are not tied to a specific field.
